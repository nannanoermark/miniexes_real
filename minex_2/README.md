•	Describe your program and what you have used and learnt


In this mini exercise I wanted to follow the very kliché way of looking at the notion of fun. Fun executed by an entertainer that causes laughter amongst the on-lookers. This time I wanted to add a kind of interaction within my program. I had an idea, that the mouse should be the focus of interaction. I therefore created a clown head out of shapes and colors. I used rect(), ellipse() and arc(). I’ve learned quite a bit of placing the shapes the way I have imagined it in my mind. The biggest challenge was to make the mousePressed function. 
I wanted to make it possible to place to mouth of the clown anywhere on the screen, so that would be the element of surprise and “fun”. A pinãta-effect  I had to make two variables that I called x and y, before my function setup (). Then in my “mouth” ellipse (); I called my x and y coordinates x,y. So in that case, the coordinates are any coordinate. After all the shape syntaxes I call the MousePressed function(); I specify that I want the mouth-ellipse to appear in any x and y coordinate everytime the mouse is pressed. Besides, I had to move background(); to the function draw(); so that background loops with the “mouth”-ellipse. 


•	What is fun? To what extend your program addresses Goriunova's noton of fun? Is it fun in relation to geekiness, or humour, or paradox, or other modes of thoughts? (This question requires your articulation of your work beyond just describing how it works technically)
This program refers to the quite simple and childish humour. As Goriunova explains, fun should be seen as more than just laughter and absurdity, but the notion of fun can also be found when we use our logic and try to go beyond the possible in for example programming. I wanted to take it back to the “childish” notion of fun. There’s no actual goal in the program, just the quirky function of moving the mouth around, so that the clown looks whimsical.
