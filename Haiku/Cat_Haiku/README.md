## Lost in Translation 
The Cat Haiku by Nanna Nørmark and Jonas Nordberg

### The program 

In short, this program contains several sound files with originally danish Haiku poems with the theme “cats” found on the internet. These poems has been translated into english by Google Translate. These poems show up in the program as text also in english is the user is able to read the poems, if they can’t be understood by just hearing it. Basically it is same code as Winnie’s Vocalbe code, but our mini_ex has a much different aspect than hers. 

We picked Cat Haikus because we wanted to experiment with humour as a sort of intelligence and how that can be implemented in vocable code. In the chapter about intelligence, Alan Turing attempt to make software, that can “compete” with the human reasoning and furthermore can respond to input with output. The problem is that software and code lack the understanding of symbols. This aspect of Jonas and I found interesting. We wanted to give a “obscure” twist in our program. So, we experimented with putting danish Haiku-poems about cat into Google Translate. These danish haikus already was kind of humorous before translating it, but when translating it seemed even more ridiculous. Why is that? Our argument is that the Google Translate-speaker is so monotone and somewhat serious when speaking, that it becomes ironic to us as listeners. If we, humans, had to read these poems out loud, our way of presenting it to listeners would probably be more nuanced, perhaps with laughter or a satirical imitation. But, since the Google Translate feature is software and programmed to only translate, it doesn’t pick up on these particular “semantic processing”. As John Searle’s  essay “Minds, Brains and Programs” in Vocable Code: “His observation is that syntactical, abstract or formal content of the computer is not the same as semantic or mental content associated with the human mind” 


### Language

As a human being we use language to communicate to each other. When we use the same language as the person we communicate with not much can be misunderstood. But then we also have our body language, which can be a part of understanding of the situation. 
But when we use our computers a new language is present - the machine language. This language is much stricter than the human language (except for maybe the german language…). There is no room for misunderstandings and false interpretations. A task given can only be solved in one way. So if the task is not properly defined no solution will be given by the computer. This language barrier is also something that we’ve experienced during this exercise. 
We had an idea of what we wanted to create. Once we began, we tried using Winnie’s code to have multiple sound files with text. This quickly came to work properly, but then we had some troubles with the .js file. This file had all the queer text in it, so we thought, why not change some of these so that the code itself represents what our product is about - cats. But no matter how little text we tried to change we had an error. So in the end we could only change some parameters in Winnie’s code, but not all that we wanted to do.

### The process of working in collaboration with code:
In this exercise we have worked with the Atom Teletype to be able to change and edit code together at both our computers. This has proven to be a very great way to express our ideas together, instead of just saying the code out loud. By doing so we had the chance of seeing multiple solutions much quicker than if we had to make this exercise by ourselves. The only immediate problem we had by using teletype was that only one of us could have the “master” code on our computer, which meant that it wasn’t possible to look at the code individually at home. But there must be some kind of solution to this, since it would make the process a whole lot easier.
