•	What are the rules in your generative program and describe how your program performs over time. What have been generated?

Rules of my program: 
//rules:
 1. sketch one ellipse
 
 2. let the screen have several ellipses with 20 pixels in between them with a speed on 0.01 
 
3. at the specific size of the ellipses (r>3) the direction of the ellipses increase or decrease changes


In this program the small ellipses move and harmonically expands and increase in size and the canvas therefore almost to shift in coloring. I wanted my program and the generativity to be “rhythmic” in a sense, so the movements almost reminds me of waves or a beat that has somewhat of a slow pace and furthermore your eyes get sort of comfortable watching over time. A relaxing generativity. 
In my program the ellipse is “duplicated” through the for loops(); . The ellipse that I coded has been generated through speed and furthermore a maximum and minimum size and therefore changes direction 

•	How does this mini-exericse help you to understand what might be generativity? (see the above - objective 3)
In this program there’s so many small ellipses that appears in the program, but -like Winnie’s code from class the lines of code are relativity short and liked it’s described in the Generativity chapter “… the computer takes on the role of the artist” (p.85). The program is set into motion and self-processed in some aspects. The creator is no longer just a single human, but especially in this program, the computer takes a big part of the creation and the outcome. In software art you could maybe talk about a new kind of artist, that with some math can create chaotic or structured systems.
