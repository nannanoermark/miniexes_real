Describe about your throbber design, both conceptually and technically.
•	What is the time-related syntax/function that you have used in your program? and why you use in this way?


In this mini ex I took a different approach and did not actually do much of the syntaxes and functions we had discussed in class, but I wanted to create a different and untraditional throbber, that might have somewhat of the same “shape” as a throbber, but had a bit more “information” to it. That’s why a decided to do a clock, very much inspired by Daniel Shiffman. So, I used the syntax, minute, hour and second and visualized the time and made a minimalistic clock with a black fill. I’ve used the shape arc to encircle the clock and lines as pointers. They are both dynamic, in that sense, that they both show time in different ways. The arces creating this “throbber-feel”, but the lines showing the time. I changed the angleMode, to DEGREES instead of the default RADIANS and using the function map() to make it follow everything clockwise.
The reason for the clock is that you get more of a “feel” to the time that you’re taking to wait for a program to load. The intention is to make the user more conscious about the waiting and the time spent, in front of a throbber anticipating an outcome. We all know the feeling, of being bored and then looking at the clock and have the feeling that time stands still. The clock functioning as a throbber could both have the effect of feeling even more impatient and bored, because you are forced to look at a moving clock and counting seconds and minutes or feeling a bit more in control and aware of the time, since the user get a way better grasp of time passing by. So, basically there could be two sides to using this as a throbber. 


•	Think about a throbber that you have encounted in digital culture e.g streaming video on YouTube or loading latest feeds on Facebook or waiting a ticket transaction, what do you think a throbber tells us, and/or hides, about? How might we think about this remarkable throbber icon differently?
I’ve took much tought into throbbers. I’ve always thought as throbbers as kind of a default in the program, I’ve have not considered that someone actually designs the throbber and decides their look. What I have taking into thought, is that there is so much a throbber hides from us and doesn’t give us any information about and it’s just a throbber going in circles. It does not even give us any hints about the process. Is there progression, regression or is the program just stuck? In most of any other aspects of our daily lives we are aware of which way things are going, but in this case, technology takes away that power from us. This relates to our last class in Software Studies talking about time and how we can feel like computers creates this time-machine for us. We can stop, pause and start, but with the throbber-concept, technology completely disables us humans in taking part of the process, because it has completely taking over this task of performing an action.
