•	Describe how does your game/game object works?


In this program the user is supposed to mark the circles with the mouse before they disappear from the canvas. There’s no actual end to the game, it’s more focused on the challenge of “catching” the bouncing circles. I played around with a bunch different movements to my class. Especially gravity, but I found it hard to make the circles have a “bottom line”, so I ended up using the random-movement, like Daniel Shiffmann uses it, with changes to it. 


•	Describe how you program the objects and their related attributes and methods in your game.
I made a class that I call “Ball”, the method in his program is the movement of the balls, that primarily is the random func(); , which the attributes x, y, r defines. r is also defined by the random func();, but is within a specified range, so that the circles are contained in a certain area for some time. And with the for loop I created 25 circles in the program. 


•	Based on Shiftman's videos, Lee's text and in-class lecture, what are the characteristics of object-oriented programming?

In object-oriented programming the object contains both the management of data and the operations, whereas structured programming is more one or the other. As Lee uses a human being as an example from the real world. There’s looks and actions and personality traits and so on. In OOP all of these attributes are combined in as an independent unity. So an object in the world of programming has certain attributes, such as movement or appearance and so on, but all comes down to that these attributes forms a identity for the object. To define such an object in programming, you call. The class is sort of the recipe for the object. Lee describes it, as the DNA or the blueprint for the object, which paints the picture quite well I think. 

•	Extend/connect your game project to wider digital culture context, can you think of a digital example and describe how complex details and operations are being abstracted and encapsulated? 


So basically, OOP reduces the original very complex nature of programming by modularity, so a small in the program have a big impact on the outcome. Like last week, with the data capture theme it got me thinking that a function such as mousepressed(); or classes and attributes again produces a certain feeling of “freedom” when we click the mouse or in broader terms, when we control an object in other ways. But, it’s always constrained by the code. This seem obvious to trained programmers, but when “normal” browsing the web for example, every website is limited to the overall classes, objects and attributes and think that’s an interesting thought.
